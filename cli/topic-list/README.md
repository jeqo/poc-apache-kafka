# `ktopiclist` - Kafka CLI topic list

Command-line tool to get a JSON representation of the topics included in a Kafka cluster.
Includes topic metadata, configuration, partitions, replica placement, and offsets.

This information is available through multiple commands, e.g. `kafka-topics`, `kafka-configs`, etc.
That's why I decided to compile it in one single tool.
